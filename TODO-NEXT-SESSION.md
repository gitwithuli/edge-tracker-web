# TODO for Next Session

## Log Dialog - Backtest Section
- Remove "Did the setup appear?" question from Backtest log type
- Reason: Backtests are logs of historical/old moves where the setup already occurred by definition, so this question doesn't make sense for backtests
- Only keep this question for Live/Fronttest logs
